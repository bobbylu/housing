###Deed Restricted Affordable Housing Data for the Bay Area

####Intro

This repository is where we track information about deed-restricted affordable housing for the purpose of land use scenario planning, analysis, and simulation. 

####Goal

To build a comprehensive database of deed-restricted affordable housing projects and relate them to individual buildings and/or parcels. 

At a minimum, we need to assign deed-restricted housing to parcels. 

In addition, we would also like to know how many units are deed-restricted by parcel.

####Data Sources

We track data sources in `data_sources.csv`
